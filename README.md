# PortScanner
This Python-based Port Scanner is a simple yet powerful tool that allows users to scan for open ports on a target system or network. The scanner utilizes socket programming to establish connections with target IP addresses and identifies the status of specific ports (open, closed, or filtered) by sending and receiving network packets.
